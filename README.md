##### Proposed Project Title: Money Buddy (Personal Financial Tracker)

Money Buddy is a personal financial tracker application that helps users effectively manage their income, expenses, and savings goals. The application provides a simple command-line interface for users to input and keep track of their financial transactions for a specific month and year, set and review savings goals, and analyze their financial performance through reports.

##### Intended User
The intended user is anyone looking to manage their personal finances, track income and expenses, and set savings goals to better plan their financial future.

##### What problem is the project trying to solve?
The project aims to address the challenge of effectively managing personal finances by providing users with an easy-to-use tool that consolidates financial information, allowing them to track income and expenses, set savings goals, and analyze their financial performance. Furthermore, if the user feels unsafe connecting their bank account to a third party app to use these tools, they can simply resort to Money Buddy

- Java Development Kit (JDK) to run an executable JAR file
- A serialized file ('financial_data.ser') for storing and loading user data.
